// got to learn about the clamp() in css.
it has 3 values a min, a baseline/preffered and a maximum.


this is used for fluid sizes based on the viewport. you find it very often in websites that scale seamlessly.

Got to refresh my memory on the setAttribute() function.
it creates an instance where we can assign a value to an attribute.

syntax
setAtribute(name, value);
